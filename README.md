## Myopically Verifiable Probabilistic Certificate for Long-term Safety



## Description

The repository constains an implementation of the paper "Myopically Verifiable Probabilistic Certificate for Long-term Safety" at the 2022 American Control Conference.



## How to run

For switching control, run `swiching.m`.

For worst case control, run `worst_case.m`.

For nonlinear system setting, run `nonlinear_swiching.m` and `nonlinear_worst_case.m`.
